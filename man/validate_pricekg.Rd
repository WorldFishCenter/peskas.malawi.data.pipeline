\title{Validate Catch Price per Kilogram}
\usage{
validate_pricekg(data = NULL, k = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing catch data with columns: form_name, survey_id, catch_taxon,
price_kg, catch_price, and catch_kg.}

\item{k}{A numeric value used in the get_pricekg_bounds function for outlier detection.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{form_name}: The name of the form associated with the survey
\item \code{survey_id}: The unique identifier for each survey
\item \code{price_kg}: The original price per kg if valid, otherwise NA
\item \code{catch_kg}: The original catch weight if price is valid, otherwise NA
\item \code{catch_price}: The original total catch price if price per kg is valid, otherwise NA
\item \code{alert_price}: A numeric value (4) indicating an outlier, or NA if the value is valid
}
}
\description{
This function validates the price per kilogram of catch data by comparing it to calculated
upper and lower bounds from the get_pricekg_bounds function. If a price value is outside
the bounds, an alert is triggered and the price, catch weight, and total catch price values
are set to NA.
}
\details{
The function first calculates price bounds using get_pricekg_bounds(). It then joins these bounds
with the input data and compares each price_kg value to its corresponding upper and lower bounds.
If the price_kg value is outside the bounds, an alert is set and the price_kg, catch_kg,
and catch_price values are changed to NA.
